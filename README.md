## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a graduate student in the Optical Science and Engineering at UNM pursuing a concentration in photonics. I work as a research assistant as well
in a group which focuses on the development and improvement of integrated optoelectronic devices. I have an interest in datascience and machine learning
and I'm looking to both share and access good information here in these areas.
